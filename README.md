# Sprint 4
Created new static class CoinCounts. CoinCounts supports the observer interface which currently has 2 types: TotalCoins and TotalQuarters. These classes have their own JFrame and JLabel. The JLabel in TotalCoins is updated every time any increment method of CoinCounts is called, but the JLabel for TotalQuarters is only updated if incrementQuarter() is called. The CoinCounts increment methods are called as needed by corresponding coin subclass constructor.
